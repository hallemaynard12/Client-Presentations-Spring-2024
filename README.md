Overview:

This repository contains the code and documentation for a churn modeling project completed for a Business Intelligence and Analytics Capstone course completed in the spring semester of 2024. In this project we used data pulled from a hypothetical credit card company and analyzed the data to predict why customers are terminating their accounts and what changes the company should impliment to make their churn rates decrease. Churn predicting refers to the process of identifying customers who are likely to stop using ther card or close their account entirely.

Dataset:

The data set used in this project was given by our professor and is comprises various attributes related to credit card usage. These attributes include Client ID, Client Attrition, Age, Gender, Dependant Count, Education Level, Marital Status, Income Category, Card Category, Months With Bank, Products by Client, Inactive In 12 Months, Contacts In 12 Months, Credit Limit, Total Revolving Balance, Average Open to Buy, Change in Transaction Amount (Q4 over Q1), Total Transaction Amount, Total Transaction Count, Change in Transaction Count (Q4 over Q1), and Average Utilization Ratio. 

Objectives:

1. Data Exploration: Understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
2. Data Cleaning: By completing steps such as checking for missing values, Imputation, addressing Multicolinearity, Removing near zero-variance variables, Standardization, and Data Partitioning helps ensure the accuracy and relevence of our data.
3. Model Building: Running Linear and Multiple regressions as well as building other models helps predict churn rates and client attrition.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and techniques
5. Deployment: Deploy the best-performing model for real-time or batch prediction of churn.
